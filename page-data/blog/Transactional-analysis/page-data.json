I have seen my friends talking for hours with their friends, some with their girlfriends. Then I joined Amazon, still struggling to have an informal talk. To undestand why this is happing to me I started looking around and came across this wonderful theory of Transactional analysis by Eric Berne.</p>\n<h3><ins>Basics of Transactional Analysis</ins></h3>\n<p>Every person have 3 states in him/her, what we call as ego states. These 3 ego states are Parent, Adult and Child.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Parent: Our parents have different reactions to situation. This ego states comprises of all those situation and how our parents reacted to it.</li>\n<li>Adult: This is considered to be the most stable state. We look at a situation and response accordingly.</li>\n<li>Child: This ego state comprises of all occurences how our parents taught us or how we responded to those situation when we were very young.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"https://healforlife-book.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Transactional-Analysis.png\" alt=\"image-title-here\"></p>\n<p>Eric said that every conversation is a transaction. Suppose I am talking to my friend Vivek. I say \"Hi\" which let us assume have a value of X. Now since I have given him some sort of value X, I assume that he would also give me something equivalent to it. Now Vivek can say \"Hi\" back, he can give emotional support in case I am sad or he can choose to ignore. If Vivek chooses to ignore, I will have an emotion anger or sadness based on what ego state I was when I did that transaction and what situation matches that scenario in that particular ego state.</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<p>Conflict arises when there is cross transaction. Suppose 2 people, lets call them A and B are talking. A is the boss of B. B had underperformed in previous quarter. A says to B that you should focus on your skills to excel in future. A had said this from parent ego state to the child ego state of B. In this scenario if B replies from adult(most stable and logical state) or child state, there would be no conflict. He can reply as \"Yes you are right, I will try to focus more on my skills\". But if B replies from parent ego state then there would be a conflict which can result in anger in person A.\nWe should always try to be in adult ego state to avoid conflict which is very very difficult.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/618/1*1xLwyfaVOqbYtdja9rh29A.jpeg\" alt=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/618/1*1xLwyfaVOqbYtdja9rh29A.jpeg\"></p>\n<h3><ins>Different types of conversation</ins></h3>\n<p>According to Eric there are 6 different ways in which people spend their time in conversation. These are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Withdrawl</li>\n<li>Ritual</li>\n<li>Pastime</li>\n<li>Activities</li>\n<li>Games</li>\n<li>Intimacy</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can google to know more about them. Here we will talk about Games only because these are the most imteresting ones.</p>\n<h3><ins>Games</ins></h3>\n<p>We will be only talking about conversation of two people. In these types of converstaion one person have a hidden psychological agenda which he may or may not know about. Every games have these 3 neccessary requirements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Con: He/She is the one with the hidden psychological agenda. Agenda can be a anything i.e. emotional imbalance, feeling of superiority, etc.</li>\n<li>Gimmick: The insecurity of the other person which the con uses to complete his/her agenda.</li>\n<li>Payoff: This is what the con wins, in some cases both the parties win something from the game.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lets take a look at one of the games <code class=\"language-text\">Why don't you?...Yes but..</code></p>\n<h4><ins>Why don't you?.. - Yes but..</ins></h4>\n<p>Suppose two people are discussiong about a programming problem. Person A asks B that he is not able to solve a problem. This is how the conversation goes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A: I am not able to solve this problem.</li>\n<li>B: Why dont you ask Amit? He has solved this before.</li>\n<li>A: Yes but it appears he is too busy.</li>\n<li>B: Ok, why don't you try solution X?</li>\n<li>A: Yes but, I dont have the permission.</li>\n<li>B: You can try performing Y</li>\n<li>A: Yes but I dont think it would work.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This would go on and on till B dont have any solution. A here is the con, the gimmick was the inability of B to say that A should try first before giving absurd reasons to not doing it. The payoff is that A believes that the problem is not solvable or he wanted to see B's inability to solve an issue. Again this might not be a known agenda of A. </p>\n<p>There are many other social games which Eric proposed. There are games we play in our day to day life and are not able to see them. I have seen people play many other transactional games as well, will not disclose them here beacuse even I want to have a larger chunk of the transaction we might have in the future.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Transactional Analysis - Short introduction","author":"Aditya Singh","date":"24 January, 2021"},"excerpt":"The most basic in human psychology is \"Why do we talk?\".
