I am not talking about \"what a person thinks\" but \"how a person thinks\". If this was possible I will try the method on myself. I will probably write a blog about how I think some time later. This blog is totally dedicated new beginnings.</p>\n<p>I recently won 300 rs gift card after winning a competetion in Amazon (dont judge). I had the oppurtunity of using that so I used it to buy a book, \"Approaching (almost) any ML problem\". Now I haven't read that book yet but it got me thinking that how much I have changed. Aditya from 2 years back would have spend the amount on some absurd gadget. I have started spending money on things which will be useful to me or which can add value to my life in the long run. I am very proud of this change.</p>\n<p>I have started reading books, and with dedication. I dont like fictional books. Currently I am reading, \"Emotional Intelligence by Daniel Goleman\", about how the human brain evolved and why sometimes emotions takeover logical reasoning. This is again one of the steps which I have taken to improve myself as a person. If you are into psychology be it any kind then we can definitely talk for minutes (dont have that much depth to talk for hours, but I am trying).</p>\n<p>Recently I installed an app to improve my productivity by tracking items. We as humans unknowingly spend too much time on things which dont add any value to our life. If at the end of the day you can see the difference between the task completed and not completed, it will have a huge impact on your behavior the very next day.</p>\n<p>Now if you have read my earlier blogs, this blog might appear to be an outlier. You are right, but moving forward I will be writing more about my life, events, my understanding of the world and every other thing. When I am old, all this will be a great source of entertainment for me. Sorry for adrupt ending.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"New beginning","author":"Aditya Singh","date":"18 January, 2022"},"excerpt":"New Beginnings It would have been great if there was a way using which we can actually tell how a person thinks.
