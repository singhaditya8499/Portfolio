- This was my first company and I got this oppurtuniy by attending a job fair in college.</p>

* My work included working on a prototype to design a smart attendance system for the company.</p>

* We used raspberry pi as our hardware and used opencv, python to design a functional face recognition system with email triggers integrated with the system.</p>
