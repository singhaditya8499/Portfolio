# Differences, Clinical psychology and Happiness

The main questions are:

1. How we are different from other people?
2. Why we are different from other people?

The main difference in 2 persons are:

### Personality

To measure the personality we use reliability and validity.

Harrower-Erickson Multiple Choice Rorschach Test is a test which was used earlier to test personality, although there is no way to test its validity.

The big five personality factors:

1. Neurotocism - Stability (N)
2. Extrovert - Introvert (E)
3. Openness to experience - Non openness (O)
4. Agreeableness - Antagonism (A)
5. Conscientiousness - Undirectedness (C)

This is the Big five test (OCEAN) and it is stable and there is a way to validate it.

### Intelligence

People have different opinion about what intelligence means. Charles Spearmen defined intelligence as two factors, i.e. general intelligence (g, accounts for similarity) and specific ability (s, accounts for differences).

### Behavioural genetics

We are different because of these regions:

1. Genes and environment
2. Nature vs Nurture

The findings of behavioural genetics:

1. High heritability in all cases when talking about psychology
    1. The flynn effect: We use same scale to test IQs for people of different generations. If we dont use the same scale, then we can see that the average IQ is rising rapidly in the last 70-100 years.
2. Rest of the variance in a group comes from non shared environment.

### Parenting

Shared environment does'nt matter. Parents dont matter in IQ, they just impact the hereditory part. Their parenting technique does'nt matter. Peers matter more than the parents.

# Clinical psychology

Also known as psychopathology.

The basic malfunction is unable to sequence your thoughts and corrdinate them. Further problem arises due to loss of contact. Too much dopamine is found in schizophrenic patients. Possible causes early on can be oxygen deprivation while birth, prenatal infections or difficult family circumstances.
